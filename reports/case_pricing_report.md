1. Overview

Policy ID: 417

Insured: Example Manufacturing & Distribution Group

Line of Business: Casualty / General Liability

Territories: London, Midlands, Wales, North West

Exposure Basis: Turnover (£m) & Payroll (£m)

Limits: £5m per occurrence

Deductible: £10,000

Underwriter: [Name]

This report evaluates the technical premium required for a multi-location corporate liability programme and compares it with a hypothetical quoted premium. Results are based on portfolio-level frequency/severity models developed in the Casualty Pricing Project.


2. Exposure Summary
Key Exposure Insights

Total turnover across locations: £3.2m

Industry mix includes Manufacturing (higher severity), Logistics (higher frequency) and Retail (moderate risk).

Two locations in London, which has above-average severity.

Higher-risk activity: Manual materials handling in logistics operations → pushes frequency.

3. Risk Assessment
Risk Drivers

Industry mix

Logistics contributes higher frequency (manual work, injury exposure).

Manufacturing contributes higher severity (machinery-related injuries).

Regional risk

London tends to show ~20% higher severity in the portfolio model.

Wales & Midlands have slightly below-average severity.

Concentration of exposure

Head Office + Retail Outlet 1 = 50% of turnover located in London.

Limit profile

£5m limit → high potential for large losses, especially in manufacturing.

Overall Risk Level: Moderate-High

This combination typically indicates a technical premium uplift compared to a standard retail-only risk.

4. Technical Pricing Methodology

The technical premium is derived using the following steps:

1. Frequency Model (Poisson Regression)

Predicts expected number of claims based on:

Industry factor

Region factor

Exposure (turnover)

Deductible & limit features

2. Severity Model (Log-Linear Regression)

Estimates average claim size based on:

Industry

Region

Exposure scale

Limit selection

3. Expected Loss Cost
Expected Loss Cost = Expected Frequency × Expected Severity

4. Loadings Applied

Risk load: 10%

Expense ratio: 25%

Profit margin: 5%

5. Technical Premium Formula
Technical Premium = (Expected Loss Cost × Risk Load)
                   / (1 − Expense Ratio − Profit Margin)
Model Output Summary

Expected annual frequency: 0.47 claims

Expected average severity: £42,800

Expected annual loss cost:

0.47 × £42,800 ≈ £20,116


Risk-loaded loss cost:

£20,116 × 1.10 = £22,128


Technical premium:

£22,128 / (1 − 0.25 − 0.05)
= £22,128 / 0.70
≈ £31,610

Comparison to Quoted Premium
Metric	Amount
Technical Premium	£31,610
Quoted Premium	£28,000
Premium Adequacy Ratio	0.89

Interpretation:
A ratio below 1 indicates the quoted premium is below the technical requirement, suggesting expected long-term unprofitability unless adjusted.

6. Recommendation to Underwriter

The quoted premium of £28,000 is approximately 11% below the technical premium indication of £31,610.
Based on the portfolio model outputs and the risk profile, I recommend increasing the premium or adjusting terms to maintain expected profitability.

Suggested Actions

Premium Adjustment

Recommend a premium in the range £31,000–£33,000.

Alternative options (if premium adjustment not feasible):

Increase deductible from £10,000 → £25,000

Apply industry-specific endorsements

Introduce claims control warranties (especially for logistics segment)

Key Points to Monitor at Renewal

Injury frequency trends in logistics locations

Severity inflation for machinery-involved claims

Turnover growth in London (higher severity region)

7. Assumptions & Limitations

Historical portfolio patterns are assumed to be representative of future risks.

No explicit inflation, Ogden, or large loss load beyond risk factor adjustments.

Severity model uses log-linear structure (simplified GLM).

No reinsurance costs included.

Exposure declared as annual turnover; assumed accurate.

Deductible erosion effects not explicitly modelled.
